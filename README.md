# Face Expression Recognition Model

This repository contains a trained deep learning model for face expression recognition. The model is capable of detecting facial expressions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple layers:

- Convolutional layers with varying filter sizes
- Batch Normalization layers for regularization
- Activation functions (ReLU) for introducing non-linearity
- Max Pooling layers for downsampling
- Dropout layers for preventing overfitting
- Fully connected layers for classification
- Output layer with softmax activation

## Model Training

The model was trained using a dataset of labeled facial expression images. The training process involved the following steps:

- Data preprocessing: The images were resized to 48x48 pixels and converted to grayscale. Data augmentation techniques such as rescaling, shifting, rotation, and horizontal flipping were applied to increase the dataset's diversity.
- Model compilation: The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
- Training: The model was trained for 50 epochs using a batch size of 128. The training progress was monitored, and the weights of the best-performing model were saved using ModelCheckpoint.
- Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated on a separate validation dataset to measure its performance in terms of accuracy and loss.

## Model Usage

To use the trained model for facial expression recognition, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies (Keras, OpenCV, etc.).
2. Load the trained model from the provided weights file.
3. Use OpenCV to capture video frames.
4. Detect faces in the frames using Haar cascades.
5. Preprocess the face regions by resizing them to 48x48 pixels and converting to grayscale.
6. Feed the preprocessed face regions into the model for prediction.
7. The model will output the predicted facial expressions for each face detected.
8. Display the results on the frames and visualize the recognized expressions.

## Model Deployment and Monitoring

The trained model can be deployed in various production environments for real-time facial expression recognition. Consider the following aspects for model deployment and monitoring:

- Package the model with its dependencies to ensure easy deployment.
- Store the model artifacts and weights in a secure and accessible location.
- Monitor the model's performance and accuracy periodically.
- Collect data on model usage to understand its performance in different scenarios.
- Monitor model drift and retrain the model periodically to maintain accuracy.
